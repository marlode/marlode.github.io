								<p class="lead">
									The projects or work you see here are internship or job related which is where I spend most of my time doing any real programming. I plan on working on
									side projects when I have the time but it has its difficulties given the fact that I have a full-time job, ride freestyle BMX, goto the gym, and have people in my life that I care about deeply. 
									Nevertheless, feel free to hover on any of the images to learn more about myself and that project.

											side of Chicago in the West Lawn area from immigrant parents. I have been worked every summer since 2017 in anything tech related which you can also find here on this page.
											As much as I enjoy coding, I also relish spending my time away from the screen spending time on my hobbies or simply enjoying the small things of life. ">

											<a class="btn image fit" data-bs-toggle="popover" data-bs-title="University of Chicago" data-bs-content="During the summer of 2019 I had an important career-defining internship at the University of Chicago.
											I was able to independantly, efficiently, and productively produce work for the Identity and Access Management department. I worked primarily with legacy web pages and tuned them using Bootstrap to make them both responsive and mobile-friendly. When the department finally had time to 
											tune up the respective web applications months later, I saw that most of my changes had been put into production!">

											<a class="btn image fit" data-bs-toggle="popover" data-bs-title="Northwestern Mutual" data-bs-content="I had two internships here at Northwestern Mutual before I became a full-time salaried employee. Despite both of these internships happening during the 
											COVID summers of 2020 and 2021, these two virtual experiences were extremely rewarding in a myriad of different ways. It is important to note that I earned these experiences both by luck and hard work. There's a long story behind that statement which I will disclose only upon request. Nevertheless, I love working here."><img src="images/NM.png" alt=""></a>

											<a class="btn image fit" data-bs-toggle="popover" data-bs-title="University of Illinois at Springfield" data-bs-content="This is where I earned my B.S in C.S. I graduated Magna Cum Laude within 3 years because of college credits I earned in high school
											and taking more than the necessary credit hours nearly every semester. I chose this school primarily for its generous scholarships and small-campus lifestyle. Although leaving my hometown felt natural, adjustment didn't come easy. Nevertheless, I made the absolute most of my time, and will forever cherish the fleeting yet lasting experiences of the ordinary college student."><img src="images/uis.png" alt=""></a>

											<a class="btn image fit" data-bs-toggle="popover" data-bs-title="Youth Guidance" data-bs-content="During the summer of 2017, the Tech Coordinator at my high school hired me through Youth Guidance to help him set up tech inventory alongside a few other individuals who were also a part of the Tech Team as they called it.
											Although this wasn't much of an internship, it was my first job doing all the things I thorougly enjoyed. Even though there wasn't any coding involved, it shot a jolt of ambition through me to continue down the path of computer science. We got a lot done, but it was hands down one of the funnest internships I had. "><img src="images/yg.png" alt=""></a>

											<a class="btn image fit" data-bs-toggle="popover" data-bs-custom-class="custom-popover" data-bs-title="Apple" data-bs-content="During the summer of 2018 I was a part of an Apple Coding Club sponsored by Apple for a program called the Everyone Can Code initiative where me and plenty of others were hired through One Summer Chicago. We spent about 4 weeks learning the Swift Programming Language
											which culminated to building an app and going through rounds of competition. My team and I only made it to the 2nd to last round, but we all performed well and the learning was great since the curriculum was structured well and organized methodically.

											<a class="btn image fit" data-bs-toggle="popover" data-bs-title="Powerlifting" data-bs-content="Since my sophomore year of high school I have been powerlifing. Powerlifting is easily described as a strength sport in which an individual trains to be the strongest in three movements. I picked it up as a hobby after I dropped volleyball my freshman year and made an effort to do more with my time
											besides play video games. It has been a long journey full of ups, downs, injuries, and progress. I don't quite take it as seriously as I did during the first 4 years, yet I still make it to the gym at least 4 times a week provided that I have the time, health, and energy for it that week. "><img src="images/bb.jpg" alt=""></a>

										<div class="col-4 col-6-medium col-12-small">
											<a class="btn image fit" data-bs-toggle="popover" data-bs-title="Software Engineering" data-bs-content="I always considered Software engineering more of a career rather than a passion or even a hobby. Which could make it the most important part of my life depending on how you look at it. Be that is it may I sincerely relish the moments when I run my code with no errors and the intended output is present. However, by no means do I ever shy away from debugging. 
											On an another note, I should note that in certain specific terms I owe the majority of my professional success to my oldest brother and Jesus Magana, a friend of my oldest. By no means does that signify I did not put in the hard work, but what it does mean is that they opened doors for me, some I never imagined to exist.  "><img src="images/htmlogo.jpg" alt=""></a>

										<div class="col-4 col-6-medium col-12-small">
											<a class="btn image fit" data-bs-toggle="popover" data-bs-title="BMX" data-bs-content="I picked up riding bikes around my senior year of highschool. I wanted to skateboard originally, but I opted for BMX because thats what my brother did and it was, to me, more practical. I didn't start taking it more seriously, until the pandemic summer of 2020 when the gyms closed and I didn't have much to do.
											Since then I have injured myself numerous times but it provides me with a thrill, adrenaline, and serenity unmatched by anything else I have done. Because I still care about my well-being and longevity, I don't ride all the time but I try to make time at least once a week."><img src="images/bmx.jpg" alt=""></a>
